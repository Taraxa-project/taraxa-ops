# Running Taraxa-node at Digital Ocean
You only need a Digital Ocean account to be able to run a Taraxa-node against the testnet.
Follow this instructions to get a Digital Ocean account https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/getting-started/sign-up/

## One Click Install
You need a Digital Ocean API token to use One Click Install.
Follow [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/) to get it.

You may export your token as the env var `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` or insert it when script ask for it.

To have your Taraxa-node Runing just run:
```
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/master/scripts/one-click-DO.sh)"
```

Each time you run the script, a new droplet will be launched at Digital Ocean.

## Running it manually
Now lets create our `taraxa-node` droplet.

### Create the droplet
#TODO: Verify recommended resources

1.  From the  **Create**  menu in the top right of the  [control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), click  **Droplets**.
2.  Choose the Ubuntu 18.04.3 (LTS) x64 image.
3.  Choose a  [plan and size](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/#plans-and-pricing)  for your Droplet, which determines its RAM, disk space, and vCPUs as well as its price. Learn more about  [how to choose the right Droplet plan](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/resources/choose-plan/). We recommend at least 2GB of RAM.
5.  Choose a  [datacenter region](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/#regional-availability). It can be any one available.
6.  Select additional options `User Data` and add this [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/master/scripts/ubuntu-install-and-run-node.sh) content to the `User Data` field bellow.
7.  Choose an  [SSH key](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/), if you’ve added one. If you choose not to use SSH keys, your Droplet’s password will be emailed to you after creation.
8.  Enter a name and click  **Create**. We suggest `taraxa-node`

### Connect to Droplets

To connect by using a terminal on Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux:

1.  Open your terminal, and enter the command  `ssh root@203.0.113.0`.
    Substitute in your Droplet’s IP address after the `@`.
2.  Press  `ENTER`  and answer  `yes`  to the prompt that confirms the connection.
3.  If you’re not using SSH keys, enter your password when prompted.

Windows users can alternatively  [connect with PuTTY](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/putty/).
When you’ve logged in, your command prompt changes and you’ll see a welcome screen.

### Read Taraxa-node logs
Run this command after connected to the Droplet.

```
docker logs taraxa-node
```

If you wish to tail the logs, add `-f` to the command above. **Ctrl**-**C** is needed to stop the tail.

# Running Taraxa-node at AWS
You only need an EC2 instance at AWS in order to run a Taraxa-node. To get started with AWS EC2 see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html

## One Click Install
You need an AWS account with configured credentials. If you'd like the ability to ssh into your EC2 instance you will need to setup an ssh key for use with EC2, follow these [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair).

To have your Taraxa-node running just run:
```
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/master/scripts/one-click-AWS.sh)"
```
or if you already have an ssh key to use with your Taraxa-node, run the command and pass in the name of your ssh key:
```
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/master/scripts/one-click-AWS.sh)" {KEYNAME}
```
Each time you run the script a new ec2 instance will be created.


# Running Taraxa-node at Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## One Click Install
You need a Google account with Cloud billing account setup. 
Please read about Cloud billing account here: https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account
The script will request your Google cloud billing accout ID.

The script generates a new GCP project for Taraxa node and links provided billing account to it.
Project-wide SSH keys are auto-generated by gcloud tool.
To SSH into your instance you can run `gcloud ssh <instance-name>`

To have your Taraxa-node running on GCP just run:
```
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/master/scripts/one-click-gcloud.sh)"
```
